                        <p>I created Budgie to gain some experience with data visualization and play around with a gradient-heavy visual style. The front-end is a React app that uses React Router for navigation.</p>

                        <p>The server portion was written in Java with the Spring Framework as the web layer. It uses JPA with an in-memory h2 database for storage.</p>

                        <p>I originally used the ReChart library for the data visualizations but found it wasn't as flexible as I'd like it to be, so I changed over to Chart.js and the accompanying React library for it.</p>
